Project Overview
In many colleges and schools, managing student records like admissions, attendance, and grades is often done manually or in spreadsheets. This can lead to data inconsistency, difficulty in searching, and lots of paperwork.So my aim was to build a centralized system where admins, teachers, and students could manage everything in one place efficiently.

Example:
This project is a web-based task management application that helps users organize their daily to-do lists. I built this to practice my skills in .NET development and create a tool that I personally found useful.

Technologies Used
I built this project using:
C# and .NET Framework for the backend logic
Windows Forms for the user interface
SQL Server for database storage

Frameworks:

Backend: [List backend frameworks, e.g., Microsoft ASPNET CORE , .NETCore ]

Languages:
[List languages, e.g., C# , JavaScript]

Database:
[List databases, e.g., SQL Server]

Other Tools & Libraries:
[List any other important libraries, e.g., Tailwind CSS, ]

Features
The main features and functionality I've implemented in my project are.

Feature 1: [A key feature, e.g., User authentication (login, logout, registration)]

Feature 2: [Another feature, e.g., CRUD operations for tasks (create, read, update, delete)]

Feature 3: [A Third feature, e.g., Real-time data synchronization using WebSockets]
